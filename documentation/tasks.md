# Project Refactoring Tasks

This document outlines the recommended improvements for better code organization, maintainability, and adherence to Next.js/React best practices.

## High Priority Tasks

### Task 1: Migrate to Professional Design System ✅ COMPLETED

**What**: Migrate from ad-hoc Tailwind classes to a proper design system using shadcn/ui best practices
**Why**: Current styling approach uses scattered Tailwind classes without centralized configuration, making it hard to maintain consistency and follow design best practices. A proper design system will provide better maintainability, accessibility, and developer experience.

**Scope**: Complete migration following the detailed plan in [STYLING_MIGRATION_PLAN.md](../STYLING_MIGRATION_PLAN.md)

**Key Deliverables**:

- Proper shadcn/ui component library setup
- Centralized design tokens and theme configuration
- Consistent component patterns with reusable UI primitives
- Migration of all existing components to use the design system
- Documentation and style guides for future development

**Expected Benefits**:

- Unified color palette and consistent spacing/typography
- Better accessibility with Radix UI primitives
- Type-safe styling with proper IntelliSense support
- Optimized CSS bundle size and performance
- Professional, maintainable codebase following industry standards

### Task 2: Extract Custom Hooks from Components ✅ COMPLETED

**What**: Move business logic from components into reusable custom hooks
**Why**: Components are currently mixing UI rendering with business logic, making them hard to test and maintain. Custom hooks will separate concerns and make logic reusable.

**Target Components**:

- Extract auth logic from `components/auth.tsx` into `useAuth` hook
- Extract chat functionality from `components/chat.tsx` into `useChat` hook
- Extract chat history management from `components/chat-history.tsx` into `useChatHistory` hook
- Extract Supabase operations into `useSupabase` hook

### Task 3: Break Down Large Components ✅ COMPLETED

**What**: Split oversized components into smaller, focused components
**Why**: Large components violate the Single Responsibility Principle and are harder to understand, test, and maintain.

**Target Components**:

- `components/chat.tsx` (99 lines) - ✅ Already well-structured, uses `useChat` hook
- `app/page.tsx` (79 lines) - ✅ Extracted Sidebar, MobileHeader, and MainContent components
- `components/auth.tsx` (104 lines) - ✅ Already well-structured, uses `useAuth` hook

**Completed Work**:

- Created `components/layout/` directory with focused components:
  - `Sidebar` - Handles sidebar layout, auth, and chat history
  - `MobileHeader` - Handles mobile navigation header
  - `MainContent` - Orchestrates main content area
- Reduced `app/page.tsx` from 121 to 79 lines
- Improved component separation of concerns
- Added proper TypeScript interfaces and prop definitions
- Used design system tokens for consistent styling
- Added accessibility improvements (aria-labels)
- Created barrel exports for clean imports

### Task 4: Centralize Type Definitions ✅ COMPLETED

**What**: Create a dedicated `types/` directory for all TypeScript interfaces and types
**Why**: Types are currently scattered across files, making them hard to find and reuse. Centralized types improve maintainability and consistency.

**Completed Work**:

- Created `types/` directory with organized type definitions:

  - `types/database.ts` - Database types for Supabase schema
  - `types/models.ts` - AI model types and configurations
  - `types/hooks.ts` - Custom hook return types
  - `types/components.ts` - Component prop types
  - `types/api.ts` - API request/response types
  - `types/ui.ts` - UI component types
  - `types/index.ts` - Main barrel export file

- Updated all existing files to import from centralized types
- Maintained backward compatibility with legacy type names
- Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors
- Cleaned up unused imports and resolved linting issues

**Benefits Achieved**:

- Improved type discoverability and reusability
- Better IntelliSense support for developers
- Consistent type definitions across the codebase
- Easier maintenance and refactoring of types
- Clear separation between different type categories

## Medium Priority Tasks

### Task 5: Implement Proper State Management ✅ COMPLETED

**What**: Establish clear patterns for state management using React Context or state management library
**Why**: State is currently managed at multiple levels without clear data flow, making it hard to track and debug state changes.

**Completed Work**:

- **Authentication Context**: Centralized user authentication state with `AuthProvider` and `useAuthContext`

  - Eliminated duplicate auth logic in `useAuth` and `useChat` hooks
  - Provides consistent auth state across all components
  - Handles sign-in/sign-out operations globally

- **Chat Context**: Centralized chat session and UI state management with `ChatProvider` and `useChatContext`

  - Manages selected session ID and messages
  - Controls sidebar open/close state
  - Handles chat updates and session selection
  - Provides centralized chat history reference

- **UI Context**: Global UI state management with `UIProvider` and `useUIContext`

  - Manages global loading states with optional messages
  - Handles global error states with user-friendly display
  - Provides consistent UI feedback patterns

- **Error Boundary**: Added robust error handling with `ErrorBoundary` component

  - Catches and displays context-related errors gracefully
  - Provides recovery options for users
  - Shows detailed error information in development mode

- Generic errors (unknown/unclassified)

## Low Priority Tasks

### Task 8: Reorganize Directory Structure ✅ COMPLETED

**What**: Create a more organized folder structure with proper separation of concerns
**Why**: Current structure mixes different types of code without clear boundaries, making navigation and maintenance harder.

**Completed Work**:

- **Created New Directory Structure**: Implemented comprehensive reorganization with clear separation of concerns:

  - `constants/` - Application constants and model configurations
  - `utils/` - Pure utility functions (cn, date formatting)
  - `components/features/` - Feature-specific components organized by domain:
    - `components/features/auth/` - Authentication components
    - `components/features/chat/` - Chat-related components (chat, messages, chat-history)
  - `lib/database/` - Database utilities (moved Supabase operations)
  - Enhanced existing directories with better organization

- **Improved Component Organization**:

  - Moved feature-specific components to dedicated directories
  - Maintained existing `components/ui/` for reusable UI primitives
  - Kept `components/layout/` for layout-specific components
  - Added shared components at the root level

- **Created Comprehensive Barrel Exports**: Added `index.ts` files throughout for clean imports:

  - `components/index.ts` - Main components export
  - `components/features/index.ts` - Feature components export
  - `constants/index.ts` - Constants export
  - `utils/index.ts` - Utilities export
  - `lib/index.ts` - Library utilities export

- **Maintained Backward Compatibility**:

  - Existing imports continue to work through re-exports
  - Gradual migration path for existing code
  - No breaking changes to current functionality

- **Enhanced Type Safety**: Centralized type definitions with proper exports and improved IntelliSense support

**Benefits Achieved**:
