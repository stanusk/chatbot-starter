# User Feedback Rules

Rules for providing appropriate user feedback in this chatbot application.

## Context
- When handling loading states during AI responses
- When displaying errors for authentication or AI failures
- When providing feedback for chat operations

## Instructions

### Loading States
- Show typing indicators during AI response streaming
- Use skeleton loaders for chat history loading
- Provide immediate feedback for user message submission
- Handle loading states gracefully during network issues

### Error Handling
- Display clear error messages for AI provider failures
- Show authentication errors with actionable guidance
- Handle network errors with retry options
- Provide fallback responses when AI is unavailable

### Success Feedback
- Avoid success messages for expected chat operations
- Provide subtle confirmation for settings changes
- Show progress for longer operations (file uploads, etc.)
- Use visual cues rather than toast messages when possible

### Chat-Specific Patterns
- Show message delivery status appropriately
- Handle streaming interruptions gracefully
- Provide feedback for unsaved changes
- Display session creation/switching feedback minimally

### Best Practices
- Keep error messages user-friendly and actionable
- Avoid technical jargon in user-facing messages
- Provide retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Use progressive disclosure for detailed error information
