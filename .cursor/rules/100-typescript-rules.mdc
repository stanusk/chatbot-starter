# TypeScript Rules

Follow these instructions when working with TypeScript in this Next.js project.

## Instructions
- Define data structures with interfaces or types for type safety
- Place types used within one file only at the end of that file
- Place shared types in `lib/types.ts` or create specific `.types.ts` files
- Avoid `any` type - utilize the type system fully
- Use JSDoc comments for complex functions and keep them updated
- Leverage TypeScript's strict mode features

### Next.js Specific
- Properly type Server Component props and params
- Use proper typing for API route handlers
- Type database schema interfaces consistently with Supabase generated types
- Use proper typing for Vercel AI SDK streaming responses
