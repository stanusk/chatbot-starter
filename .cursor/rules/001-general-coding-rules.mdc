# General Coding Rules

Rules to be followed for analyzing, writing, debugging, planning, and refactoring code in this Next.js/React chatbot project.

<critical>
- This is a Next.js 15 App Router project with React Server Components - follow Next.js patterns over traditional SPA patterns
- WHENEVER YOU'RE USING THESE RULES, always include "BASED ON CODE RULES" in the first line
</critical>

## Instructions

<critical>
- ALWAYS follow general best practices unless instructed otherwise
- Apply immutability and pure functions where applicable
- Use declarative programming patterns
- Optimize for readability and maintainability
- Always assume that a dev build with hot reload is being run, so don't try to run it manually yourself
</critical>

- Keep React components under 300 lines
- Keep utility functions and hooks under 200 lines
- Use [003-refactoring-rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/003-refactoring-rules.mdc) when files exceed ideal size
- Name functions based on what they do, not what they react to

## Simplicity Principles
- **Prefer simple solutions**: Before adding complex state management, try simpler approaches first
- **Avoid premature abstractions**: Don't create complex patterns until you have 3+ use cases
- **Use platform defaults**: Prefer `null` over custom constants, direct props over complex context patterns

### Project Structure
- Keep components focused on single responsibility
- Place shared components in `components/` directory
- Place shared utilities in `lib/` directory
- Place custom hooks in `hooks/` directory
- Maintain reasonable DRY principles
- Break complex components into smaller, composable parts

### React Patterns
- Prefer React Server Components when possible
- Use Client Components only when necessary (interactivity, hooks, browser APIs)
- Use custom hooks for complex stateful logic
- Extract reusable UI patterns into separate components
- Keep business logic separate from presentation logic

### Error Handling
- **See [601-user-feedback-rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/601-user-feedback-rules.mdc#error-handling) for complete error handling guidelines**
- **NEVER use `console.error`** - Always use centralized `ErrorHandlers` from `@/lib/error-handling`
