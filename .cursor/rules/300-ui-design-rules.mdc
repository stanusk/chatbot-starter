# UI & Design Rules

Rules for implementing UI components and styling in this Next.js chatbot project.

<critical>
- For comprehensive patterns and examples, reference `documentation/design_system_style_guide.md`
- This file contains AI-focused guidance; the style guide contains detailed implementation patterns
</critical>

## Context
- When creating or modifying React components
- When implementing shadcn/ui components
- When writing Tailwind CSS classes
- When designing chat interface elements

## Instructions

<critical>
- WHENEVER YOU'RE USING THESE RULES, START WITH "BASED ON OUR DESIGN SYSTEM"
- ALWAYS use design tokens (CSS custom properties) instead of arbitrary values
- ALWAYS check if shadcn/ui has a component before creating custom ones
- Follow the component creation checklist from the design system style guide
- Use `class-variance-authority` for component variants when needed
</critical>

### Design Token Usage
- Colors: Use `bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `bg-primary`, etc. (never arbitrary colors)
- Spacing: Use design system scale (`p-4`, `gap-4`, `mb-6`) over arbitrary values
- Chat colors: Use `bg-chat-user`, `bg-chat-assistant`, `bg-chat-reasoning`
- Border radius: Use `rounded-lg`, `rounded-md`, `rounded-sm` (based on `--radius`)

### Component Patterns
- Build through composition, not monolithic components
- Use `forwardRef` for all UI primitives
- Follow variant-based component pattern with `cva`
- Import from barrel exports: `import { Button, Card } from "@/components/ui"`

### Chat-Specific UI
- Follow established message bubble patterns
- Use consistent spacing and typography for readability
- Implement proper loading states for streaming responses
- Maintain chat history scroll behavior patterns

### Accessibility
- Ensure proper keyboard navigation for chat interface
- Use semantic HTML for screen readers
- Implement proper focus management for modal interactions
- Follow ARIA patterns for dynamic content updates
